(** The M0 kernel suite (brief section 3.11).  Six groups run in one
    order and each prints its own count, then one verdict line closes
    the run:

    - PARSE, the round trip of Stage A, over every ".kan" file of
      fixtures/, of neg/ and of erase-neg/;
    - CHECK, one line per positive fixture, where OK means the file
      elaborates, checks, and prints the byte for byte text of
      golden/NAME.checked;
    - ERASE, one line per positive fixture, where OK means the same
      file erases and prints the byte for byte text of
      golden/NAME.erased (Stage C, brief section 3.6);
    - NEG, one line per negative, where OK means the file fails and
      [Error.message] equals the single line of neg/NAME.err;
    - ERASE-NEG, one line per erasure negative, where OK means the file
      checks and its erasure fails with the single line of
      erase-neg/NAME.err (M1 Stage G, brief 3.8);
    - KNEG, the shapes M0 declares and does not admit, reached from
      OCaml because no surface production spells them.

    One argument, the test root, not the fixtures directory (SB-D15);
    [root_default] when the argument list is empty.  The suite never
    leaves the result track:  it throws no OCaml failure of its own,
    and the stdlib file calls that can fail pass through the one
    boundary [attempt_sys] below, which reports the failure as a FAIL
    line (SA-D19).

    A FAIL line carries its reason after a colon, in every group, so a
    mutation run reads why a fixture died and not only that it did
    (SB-D36).  The count lines and the verdict line hold the shape the
    gates read. *)

let root_default : string = "test"

(** The file boundary moved to test/sys_io.ml at Stage D (SD-D14).  Two
    runners live under test/ from Stage D on, main.exe and wasm.exe, and
    both read files;  one catch site serves both, so the repository still
    holds exactly one of them, which gate SD-G11 of the brief reads. *)

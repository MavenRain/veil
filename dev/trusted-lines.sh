# dev/trusted-lines.sh [ROOT]
# The TRUSTED-LINES leg of the gate battery (Stage E, brief 3.5.1).
# Example:
#   zsh /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/trusted-lines.sh
#
# The trust base of a checked file is the kernel and the encoder.  The
# kernel is eight files:  shape.ml, term.ml, rules.ml, check.ml,
# value.ml, eval.ml, conv.ml and totality.ml.  The encoder is one file,
# wasm/gc_encode.ml, which writes the bytes of the module.  M0 holds the
# kernel at 4,000 lines and the encoder at 600, so the base stays small
# enough for one reader to audit. (ruling round 2026-09-06 (c))
#
# The line prints the two counts against their bounds:
#   TRUSTED-LINES kernel=2305/4000 encoder=216/600 OK (ruling round 2026-09-06 (c))
#
# SA-D7: the root comes from this script's own path when no argument is
# given, so a copy of the repository under a scratch directory measures
# itself.  wc and awk do the reading;  grep, sed and find are never
# called.

set -u

# The user shell startup files add a chpwd hook that reads an unset
# parameter.  Under set -u that hook fails, so the hooks are cleared.

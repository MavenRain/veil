# dev/r0-audit.sh [ROOT]
# The R0-AUDIT leg of the gate battery (Stage E, brief 3.5.1).  Example:
#   zsh /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/r0-audit.sh
#
# R0 is the shape row that M0 carries.  The five shape names of
# lib/shape.ml stay inside the four files that own them:  shape.ml
# declares them, rules.ml holds the rule pack, pp.ml prints them and
# erase.ml reads them.  circuit.ml also spells shape names because it
# pattern-matches on Term.t to refuse SPar/SNu/SZk/SFhc/SMpc, so it joins
# the allowlist too.  Under wasm/ only emit.ml names a shape.  A hit
# anywhere else is a shape that leaked into the checker, the evaluator,
# conversion or the encoder, which R0 forbids at M0.
#
# SD-D29:  ripgrep reads a glob that stands after the pattern as a path,
# so every --glob stands before the pattern and the pattern rides behind
# -e.
#
# SA-D7: the root comes from this script's own path when no argument is
# given, so a copy of the repository under a scratch directory audits
# itself.  rg does the reading;  grep, sed and find are never called.

set -u

# The user shell startup files add a chpwd hook that reads an unset
# parameter.  Under set -u that hook fails, so the hooks are cleared.

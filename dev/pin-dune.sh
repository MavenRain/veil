# dev/pin-dune.sh ARGS...
# Runs dune from the zxcaml-p1 opam switch inside the tot pin worktree.
# Every dune call at Stage 0 goes through this runner, for example:
#   zsh /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/pin-dune.sh build
# The pin sources are never edited.

set -u

# The user shell startup files add a chpwd hook that reads an unset parameter.
# Under set -u that hook fails and cd inherits its non-zero status, so the hooks
# are cleared before the cd.  Timing stays honest: no hook runs in a timed call.

unfunction chpwd 2>/dev/null

# The library search prefix follows the same switch as PATH, so an active
# opam switch elsewhere in the calling shell cannot hide zarith from dune.

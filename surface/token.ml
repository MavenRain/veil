(** The token kinds of the M0 surface grammar, SPEC.md section 9.
    [Unit] is the two-character form "()", one token because the
    grammar reads it as one form.  [Dot1] and [Dot2] are the pair
    projections and [Dot] with a following [Nat] is the collection
    projection (SA-D16).  [KSum] and [KProd] are the two collection type
    words that Stage B adds (SB-D1).  [KMu] opens a family declaration;
    Stage L adds [KMutual], [KMatch] and [KEnd].  [KNu] keeps the
    milestone refusal of SA-D3. *)

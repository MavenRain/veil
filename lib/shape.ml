(** The shape sum.  Plan section 4 declares it whole at Stage A and the
    later arms are refused by their milestone name (D-M0-2), so the closed
    grammar is visible in SPEC.md from the first commit.

    SA-D5: the type is polymorphic in the kernel term, so term.ml carries
    no shape name and the R0-AUDIT gate leg runs from Stage A.  This
    module and pp.ml are the only two files in lib/ that spell a shape
    name;  rules.ml joins them at Stage B. *)

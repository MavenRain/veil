(** Type directed erasure, plan section 6 "Erasure", row by row, into the
    IR of eterm.ml.  The module mirrors kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/erase.ml arm
    by arm:  tot's [ctx] of kept flags is here at [slot]
    (kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/erase.ml:9), tot's [kept_index] is [lookup]
    (:12), tot's [term] is [term] and [node] (:15), and tot's [closed] is
    [program] (:90).  tot's four term arms that M0 splits are named at
    the arm that carries them.

    What the checker has already proved (Stage B hand-off note).  Every
    type position is read at mode [Zero] through [Check.infer_univ], a
    local stamped [Zero] is readable at mode [Zero] alone, and a runtime
    read of one is [Error (Quantity ..)].  So erasure drops exactly the
    binders stamped [Zero], the positions whose term is a type and the
    positions whose term is a proof, and no runtime position reads one of
    them.

    Classification is type directed and asks the checker (SC-D4).  A
    position carries the type its parent expects, or the type
    [Check.infer] reads out of it when the parent expects none, because
    [Check.infer] refuses a section and an injection exactly as the
    checker does (SC-D23).  Emission walks the original syntax: a
    primitive application stays a [KApp] of a [KGlobal].  The checking
    environment retains let definitions and instantiates dependent
    fibres at their points, just as the checker does.  These semantic
    values resolve types only; they never replace emitted runtime terms.

    This file spells shape names, and plan section 9 excludes it from the
    R0-AUDIT gate leg for that reason.  It is not in the trusted base:
    every erased declaration is re-checked by its golden. *)
